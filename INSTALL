INSTALLING 
----------

Download a zip file from GitHub and unzip it.  You'll need a compiler.
Open a Terminal and cd into the source directory, then type:

    make && sudo make install

That should work on Mac or Linux.  On Windows, open the Makefile and edit
three lines so they look like this using Notepad++ or similar:

    # For windows
    OBJ = resolvr.o realpath.o 
    #OBJ = resolvr.o

then do make as above (if you have gcc) or nmake (if you have Visual
Studio), then put the binary somewhere on your path.

I may make an installer at some point in the future if people ask for it.
